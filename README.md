Module 4 Challenge 
Included is a DOCX. file titled "Data In The Classroom" that is more reader friendly. I took an in-depth approach to this challenge because it speaks to me as an educator, and I enjoy writing. I aspire to become a data storyteller so this was challenge was especially enjoyable. I completed this challenge with some guidance from instructional staff, peer review, and suggested proof editing from Chatgpt.
