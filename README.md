Module 4 Challenge 
Included is a DOCX. file titled "Data In The Classroom" that is more reader friendly. I took an in-depth approach to this challenge because it speaks to me as an educator, and I enjoy writing. I aspire to become a Business Analysis & Data Storyteller so this challenge was especially enjoyable.
