# pandas-challenge

Included in the "PyCitySchools" folder is a DOCX. file titled "Data In The Classroom" that is a more reader friendly file. I took an in-depth approach to this challenge because it speaks to me as an educator, and I enjoy writing. I aspire to become a Business Analyst & Data Storyteller so this challenge was especially enjoyable.
